## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have:
- Git configured with your TYPO3.org email
- SSH key uploaded to review.typo3.org
- Docker (for DDEV) or native PHP 8.2+ environment

## Installation

### Option 1: Via Netresearch Marketplace (Recommended)

```bash
/plugin marketplace add netresearch/claude-code-marketplace
```

Then browse skills with `/plugin`.

### Option 2: Download Release

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/netresearch/typo3-core-contributions-skill/releases/latest) and extract to `~/.claude/skills/typo3-core-contributions/`

### Option 3: Manual Installation

Use this skill in Claude Code by referencing it from your project's skill configuration.

### Usage

The skill activates automatically when working on TYPO3 Core contributions. It guides you through:

1. **Setup Phase**: Prerequisites verification, environment configuration
2. **Development Phase**: Code changes, testing, validation
3. **Submission Phase**: Gerrit patch submission, CI monitoring, WIP management
4. **Review Phase**: Addressing reviewer feedback, iterating on changes

## Scope

**This skill covers**: TYPO3 Core code contributions (PHP, JavaScript, CSS, tests)
- Submission via Gerrit (review.typo3.org)
- Git commit-msg hooks and validation
- Forge issue tracking
- GitLab CI/CD pipeline

**Not covered**: TYPO3 Documentation contributions
- For documentation work, use: https://github.com/netresearch/typo3-docs-skill
- Documentation uses GitHub Pull Requests, not Gerrit
- Different format (reStructuredText) and workflows

```

## Key Workflows

### 1. Initial Setup

```bash
# Verify prerequisites
./scripts/verify-prerequisites.sh

# Setup TYPO3 Core development environment
./scripts/setup-typo3-coredev.sh
```

### 2. Create Patch

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/issue-number-description

# Make changes, commit with proper format
git commit -m "[BUGFIX] Fix indexed search null handling

Resolves: #105737
Releases: main"
```

### 3. Submit to Gerrit

```bash
# Submit as WIP (Work in Progress)
git push origin HEAD:refs/for/main%wip

# After CI passes, mark as ready
git commit --amend --allow-empty --no-edit
git push origin HEAD:refs/for/main%ready
```

### 4. Handle CI Failures

The skill provides systematic debugging:
1. Check ALL failed job logs
2. Identify failure patterns (cgl, phpstan, unit tests)
3. Fix all issues in ONE patchset
4. Re-submit and verify

## WIP State Management

### Command-Line Approach (Recommended)

```bash
# Set WIP state
git push origin HEAD:refs/for/main%wip

# Remove WIP state
git commit --amend --allow-empty --no-edit
git push origin HEAD:refs/for/main%ready
```

### Web UI Alternative

Open review URL and click "Start Review" button.

**Note**: SSH `gerrit review` command does NOT support WIP flags.

## Commit Message Format

Required structure:

```
[TYPE] Short description (max 52 chars)

Extended description explaining the why and how.

Resolves: #12345
Releases: main, 12.4
```

**Types**: BUGFIX, FEATURE, TASK, DOCS, CLEANUP, SECURITY

**Required**: At least one `Resolves:` line

**Optional**: `Related:` (but cannot be used alone)

## CI/CD Debugging

Common failure patterns:

### CGL (Code Style)
```bash
Build/Scripts/cglFixMyCommit.sh
git commit --amend --no-edit
```

### PHPStan
```bash
Build/Scripts/runTests.sh -s phpstan
# Fix reported issues
```

### Unit Tests
```bash
Build/Scripts/runTests.sh -s unit path/to/test
# Fix test failures
```

## Troubleshooting

The skill includes comprehensive troubleshooting for:

- **Account Issues**: Email mismatch, SSH authentication, commit-msg hook
- **CI Failures**: CGL, PHPStan, unit tests, functional tests
- **Gerrit Issues**: WIP state, patch conflicts, rebase requirements
- **Testing Issues**: Test failures, coverage gaps, fixture setup
- **Code Quality**: Naming conventions, type safety, defensive programming

See `references/troubleshooting.md` for detailed solutions.

## Real-World Testing

This skill was developed and validated through:

- **Forge Issue #105737**: TypeError in indexed search
- **7 patchsets** with iterative CI debugging
- **GitHub PR #397**: Documentation improvements
- **Live Gerrit testing**: WIP workflow validation

All workflows have been tested on actual TYPO3 Core submissions.
